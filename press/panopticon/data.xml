	Panopticon is a chicken-collecting action game that is designed for streamer-viewer competition through Twitch.tv.
	</description>
	
	<history>
	Panopticon was one of many, many games pitched in the UCSC Senior Game Design series. The pitch was for a exploration-survival game with Twitch integration and Natural Language Processing, called Nomad (a moniker we kept as a team name). A player would stream the game and crowd-source solutions to his/her problems. For example, if he/she needed to reach a faraway island, Twitch chatters would start buzzing about different ways of reaching that goal. Perhaps a bridge would materialize, or a boat. A team coalesced around this lofty, unorthodox game idea. We initially joked about collecting chickens as a central mechanic. And, because life is stranger than fiction, after a prototype that was considered "directionless" and many redesigns, we have arrived at what we now call Panopticon. Panopticon is an arena-style action game. Twitch chatters vote on what challenges and creatures the streamer will face in each round, with the streamer's ultimate goals being survival and, you guessed it, collection of as many chickens as possible.

		<feature>Streamer fights off waves of enemies and collects chickens, as chatters type in commands that spawn trees, bears, rock monsters, and other mayhem!</feature>
