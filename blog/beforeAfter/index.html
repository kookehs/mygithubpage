                <h3>Then and Now</h3>
                <p>
                	In the beginning we (as in Bill our lead designer) had the idea for our game to be a collaborative game
                	with Twitch working to help the player. One example would have been that in order for the player to cross
                	a river the player must collect several resources around the map. Once the player has enough then Twitch
                	would decide whether to craft a bridge, a boat, or to go moses on the river. This idea was scrapped
                	because we could not trust Twitch to be helpful and forcing the player to rely upon the Twitch chatters
                	who are notoriously known to be grievers made this idea difficult to build upon.
					<br/>
                	<br/>
					For our next design idea we were going to make it so the player could craft and work on their own and
					Twitch would try to manipulate the game world so that the player couldn’t progress easily through the
					terrain. A Twitch vs Player scenario. With the same bridge example as before the player would still
					collect resources but they would be the ones to craft the bridge that get’s them across the river. Twitch
					then to stop the player could burn down a couple of trees so the player couldn’t get wood for the bridge.
					<br/>
                	<br/>
					From the suggestion of our playtesters, three people so far, the game is now going to work in a mini-games
					type of system. This will still utilize the system from our second idea where Twitch tries to destroy the
					player, however, the player is now tasked with collecting items say some chickens and must return them to a
					central HUB. Twitch as before can throw stuff at the player, like perhaps some bears, and the player must
					defend themselves as they try to collect various items. So this version is a bit more like a battle arena.
					<br/>
                	<br/>
					So with many months and many changes we have only one key element that has remained intact in our game which
					is the use of Twitch integration. Twitch is a very difficult opponent for us, the developers.
